COVID 19,Feb-2020,Apr-2020,2,128,14.70%,-19.20,"The outbreak of COVID-19 in November 2019 forced countries to institute travel restrictions and quarantines, closing many businesses. The initial outbreak expanded into the global pandemic in March 2020."
GFC,Dec-2007,Jun-2009,18,73,10.00%,-5.10,"The subprime mortgage crisis led to the collapse of the United States housing bubble. Falling housing-related assets contributed to a global financial crisis, even as oil and food prices soared."
Dot Com - (9-11 attack),Mar-2001,Nov-2001,8,120,6.30%,-0.30,"The 1990s were the longest period of economic growth in American history up to that point. The collapse of the speculative dot-com bubble, a fall in business outlays and investments, and the September 11th attacks, brought the decade of growth to an end."
Early 1990s,Jul-1990,Mar-1991,8,92,7.80%,-1.40,"Inflation began to increase and the Federal Reserve responded by raising interest rates from 1986 to 1989. This weakened but did not stop growth, but some combination of the subsequent 1990 oil price shock, the debt accumulation of the 1980s, and growing consumer pessimism combined with the weakened economy to produce a brief recession."
Early 1980s - Part 1,Jul-1981,Nov-1982,16,12,10.80%,-2.70,"The Iranian Revolution sharply increased the price of oil around the world in 1979, causing the 1979 energy crisis. This was caused by the new regime in power in Iran, which exported oil at inconsistent intervals and at a lower volume, forcing prices up. Tight monetary policy in the United States to control inflation led to another recession."
Early 1980s - Part 2,Jan-1980,Jul-1980,6,58,7.80%,-2.20,"The NBER considers a very short recession to have occurred in 1980, followed by a short period of growth and then a deep recession. Unemployment remained relatively elevated in between recessions. The recession began as the Federal Reserve, under Paul Volcker, raised interest rates dramatically to fight the inflation of the 1970s."
